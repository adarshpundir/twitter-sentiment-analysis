# twitter-sentiment-analysis
Obejective:-
To find the sentimental score of tweets of any user .
Tools used:-
I have used python for this project. python has some libraries like tweepy it connect us directly to Twitter API(for more information visit twitter API site). now we have fetched the data from twitter and we have to calculate the sentiment score of every line of tweets.
this project contains four files:-
1) AFINN.txt
2) tweet_sentiment.py
3) Term_sentiment.py
4) twetss.py
AFINN.txt contains the score for various words (either positive and negative) the we use tweets.py file to downlaod tweet for an particular person (e.g- i used Donald Trump)
